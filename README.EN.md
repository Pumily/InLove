> 😶Don't blame me for the failure of the confession.

[中文](README.md)

## Introduction

👨‍💻How often do our programmers dare not express themselves to their favorite objects? I'm not good at words. It's very inconvenient to be rejected if I have courage😞。
In order to solve this problem, our confession app was born. If you can't say something, let the app say it for you, and deepen her love a little bit through a memory clip review. Let the other party know that it's not a fad to like her, but "a long time plan"💑。
